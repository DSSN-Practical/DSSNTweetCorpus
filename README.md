DSSNTweetCorpus
===============

Creates a live text corpus from the current (or archived) tweets from twitter.com

Usage
------

In oder to run the Project you need to have the python Twitter-API-Tool from [here](http://mike.verdone.ca/twitter/)
Furthermore you will need the tokens and consumer keys for the Twitter-Developer-API, which you can get if you ask me.

Current Output
------

Since it is unclear for now what format the text corpus should have to operate well with the Bot that handles the text or how the structure of the architecture will be the project will currently open up the public stream of twitter and will ouput all tweets that contain '#vote5sos' since it is the current most popular hashtag, plus the screenname of the user.
